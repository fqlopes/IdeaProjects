- You'll be using the following terminal operations:

    RETURN TYPE         - TERMINAL OPERATION
    long                - count()
    DoubleStatistics    - summaryStatistics()
    boolean             - allMatch
    boolean             - anyMatch
    boolean             - noneMatch

- You'll be using the operations to answer questions about a series of students
This code has a factory method, to generate a new instance of a Student, using random
data.
- This factory method will also generate some random activity, for each course passed as an
argument, to the Student constructor.

####CHALLENGE####

- Create a source for a stream of Students.
- Use the static method on Student as the Supplier.
- Use a large enough number to get a variety of Student data (no less than 1000).
- Use a combination of the intermediate and terminal operations we've covered so far, to
answer the following questions:

    - How many male and female students are in the group.

    - How many students fall into the three ages ranges:
        - Less than age 30
        - Between 30 and 60
        - Over 60 years old

- Use summaryStatistics on the student's age, to get a better idea of how old the student
population is

    - What countries are the students from? Print a distinct list of the country codes.

    - Are there students that are still active and have been enrolled for more than 7 years?

- Use one of the match terminal operations to answer this question.
- Select 5 of the students above and print their information out.
