In a new class called MainChallenge, with a main method:

- Copy the two courses, jmc and pymc, passing both
an additional argument for the lecture count. 100 and 50

- Add a third course, no lecture count needed

- Use stream.generate or iterate to generate 5k students and create
a list of these

- Use getPercentComplete method, to calculate the average percent completed
for all students just for jmc, using the reduce terminal operation

- Use this result, multiplying by 1.25, to collect a group of students(either as a list,
or a set). These would be the students who've completed more than three quarters of that
average percentage.
