Raziel:
Kain is deified.  The Clans tell tales of Him.  Few know the truth.  He was mortal once, as were we all.  However, His contempt for humanity drove him to create me, and my brethren.

I am Raziel, first-born of His lieutenants.  I stood with Kain and my brethren at the dawn of the empire. I have served Him a millennium.  Over time, we became less human and more ...divine.  Kain would enter the state of change and emerge with a new gift.  Some years after the master, our evolution would follow.  Until I had the honor of surpassing my lord.  For my transgression, I earned a new kind of reward... agony.

There was only one possible outcome - my eternal damnation.  I, Raziel, was to suffer the fate of traitors and weaklings - to burn forever in the bowels of the Lake of the Dead.

Kain:
Cast him in.

Raziel:
Tumbling, burning with white-hot fire, I plunged into the depths of the abyss.  Unspeakable pain... relentless agony... ... time ceased to exist...  ... only this torture... and a deepening hatred of the hypocrisy that damned me to this hell.

An eternity passed, and my torment receded, bringing me back from the precipice of madness.  The descent had destroyed me... and yet I lived.

Elder God:
Raziel...  You are worthy.

Elder God:
I know you, Raziel.  You are worthy.

Raziel:
What madness is this?  What pitiful form is this that I have come to inhabit?  Death would be a release, next to this travesty.

Elder God:
You did not survive the abyss, Raziel.  I have only spared you from total dissolution.

Raziel:
I would choose oblivion over this existence!

Elder God:
The choice is not yours.

Raziel:
I am destroyed!

Elder God:
You are reborn.

The birth of one of Kain’s abominations traps the essence of life.  It is this soul that animates the corpse you ‘lived’ in.  And that Raziel, is the demise of Nosgoth.  There is no balance.  The souls of the dead remain trapped.  I can not spin them in the wheel of fate.  They can not complete their destinies.

Redeem yourself.  Or if you prefer, avenge yourself.  Settle your dispute with Kain.  Destroy Him and your brethren.  Free their souls and let the wheel of fate churn again.  Use your hatred to reave their souls...  I can make it possible.  Become my soul reaver, my angel of death...

And thus, Raziel's quest for vengeance begins...

Raziel learns about the Warp Gates:

Elder God:
These gates twist space, laying a path across great spans.

When Raziel tries to activate the Warp Gate:

Elder God:
You must visit other gates before this portal will be opened to you.

As Raziel is exiting the Warp Gate chamber he falters from weakness, leaning on a pillar to catch himself.

Elder God:
You are weak - you must feed.

Raziel:
The old hunger has left me; I have no desire for blood.

Elder God:
You are changed.  Your blood-thirst is replaced by a deeper need - you have become a devourer of souls.
To sustain your strength, you must hunt the lost spirits of the Underworld, and consume the souls of your enemies.

Raziel comes to a chasm, apparently impassable:

Elder God:
Your wings, though ruined, are not without purpose.  Take hold of them as you leap, and they will carry you across this chasm.

Raziel spies a small pack of Sluagh from a safe distance; they are hunting and devouring the souls that Raziel needs to sustain his strength.  His first encounter with spectral creatures.

Raziel:
What scabrous wretches are these?

Elder God:
Sluagh, the scavengers of the Underworld.  Their feral hunger has claimed countless souls - spirits who now shall never find their rest.

Raziel encounters a material-plane portal for the first time.

Elder God:
These portals are your conduit between the spectral and material realms.  With their aid, you may gather matter and will yourself to become manifest in the physical world.
This is taxing, however - your strength must first be fully restored.
You require no conduit to return to this plane - you may abandon your physical body at any time.

After Raziel uses a material-plane portal for the first time:

Elder God:
Sustain your strength to prolong your manifestation in the physical world.  If you fail to feed, or absorb too many wounds, this fragile matter will dissolve.

The first time Raziel is thrown back to the pit of the Underworld

Elder God:
As my agent, you are beyond death, Raziel.  Your enemies cannot destroy you.
If you grow too weak, however, you will always be drawn here, to recover.

As soon as Raziel steps into the next hallway, he stops abruptly as he realizes there is water below him.  He stands at the edge and looks down, as the Elder God instructs him:

Elder God:
You are young yet, Raziel - you still retain many of your vampiric weaknesses. Immersion in water, while not fatal, will dissolve your physical body, forcing your return to the spirit world.
Be aware that in the spectral realm, water has neither heft nor lift.  It stands as thin as air.

At the other end of the hall Raziel comes upon a door.  If in spectral, the door is immovable.

Elder God:
Your efforts are futile, Raziel - such objects are but shadows in the spirit world.

Raziel first sees the devolved vampires of this new Nosgoth.

Raziel:
What are these creatures?

Elder God:
Do you not recognize them?  They are the children of your brother, Dumah.

Raziel:
That’s impossible - these foul, scuttling beasts could not be kin of our high blood.

Elder God:
Do you suppose that time stood still for you, Raziel?  Much has changed since you passed from the world of men.

Raziel establishes the rules of combat:

Raziel:
I knew my opponents’ weaknesses, having suffered them myself.  Physical wounds are fleeting - a vampire’s immortal flesh begins to close as soon as it is cleaved.

Vampires need only fear those wounds that impale, or inflame.  Water scorches like acid, and fledglings are devastated by sunlight’s touch.

I would have to modify my tactics to suit my foes.

When Raziel has dispatched his first vampire soul:

Elder God:
Unfettered from the flesh, a creature’s soul fades swiftly into the spectral realm.  Draw it in quickly, Raziel, or you will be compelled to follow.

After Raziel has destroyed the two vampires, he approaches a large stone block which, by its size, appears immovable.

Elder God:
Your physical prowess surpasses what you knew in life.  Even massive obstacles can be moved effortlessly.
